heading: Greenhouse gas sensor networks for future cities
---

CitySense promises unique sensing technologies for urban CO2 observation networks. Its core is an autonomous, low-cost CO2 sensor with unprecedented performance and miniature footprint. The novel optical configuration can be adapted for the simultaneous detection of additional trace gases, such as CH4, CO, NH3 or O3. CitySense also features a resilient, energy efficient IoT package and data-driven stochastic calibration algorithms for detailed mapping of greenhouse gases in urban areas.

Observation-based quantification of greenhouse gas emissions is a key to achieve worldwide reduction initiatives. Urban CO2 emissions are a dominating driver, which motivates spatially dense city networks for fact-based quantification. However, monitoring infrastructures are hindered by current sensors' high cost and poor autonomy. CitySense will close this gap by mass production of sensing technology, proven IoT integration, data-driven signal correction and illustrative urban implementation.
